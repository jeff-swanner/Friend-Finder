# Friend-Finder

## Description
This is a friend finder application that allows the user to answer a set of 10 survey questions and then matches the user with their closest match. Bootstrap is used for the front end interface. Node.js and express were used to create the backend server and handle routing requests. The survey responses are compared to the existing entries saved on the backend and then the new survey is saved for future use.

## How to Use
1. Clone the github repository to your computer. 
2. Navigate to the project root directory in the command line and run npm install to install the necessary node modules.
3. Run 'node server.js' in the root directory to start the express server.
4. Navigate to 'http://localhost:8080/' in a browser window to launch the application

    Alternatively, the working application is deployed on Heroku with a link provided below.
